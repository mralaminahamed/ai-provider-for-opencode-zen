## What it does

WordPress 7.0 ships a built-in **AI Client** SDK: plugins ask it to "generate text from this prompt" without caring which AI service answers. This plugin registers **OpenCode Zen** as one of those services — an AI model aggregator where a **single API key** unlocks frontier models from OpenAI, Anthropic, Google, and more.

Activate it, paste one key, and every AI-enabled plugin on your site can generate content through 61 models — no separate accounts, no per-provider billing, no code.

## Features

**One key, every model**
- **61 models** across GPT 5.x, Claude, Gemini 3.x, Qwen, MiniMax, Kimi, Grok, and DeepSeek — one OpenCode Zen key instead of an account per provider
- **Live model discovery** from the OpenCode Zen API (cached for one hour), with a built-in 61-model fallback so generation keeps working if the API is briefly unreachable
- A sensible **default model** (`gpt-5.5`) preselected out of the box

**Native WordPress integration**
- Registers as a first-class provider for the WordPress 7.0+ AI Client — any AI-enabled plugin uses it with **zero extra wiring**
- Enter your key on **Settings → OpenCode Zen**, the core **Settings → Connectors** screen, or via the `OPENCODE_ZEN_API_KEY` environment variable
- **Connection-status indicator** on the settings page and the provider logo on the Connectors screen
- Standard generation controls: temperature, max tokens, top&nbsp;P, and presence/frequency penalties

**Built to stay out of the way**
- **OpenAI-compatible** under the hood — text generation, chat history, system instructions, stop sequences, and function declarations
- Ships as both a **WordPress plugin** and a **Composer package** for standalone PHP use
- **No SDK bloat** — WordPress core provides the AI Client at runtime, and the plugin excludes its own copy to stay collision-safe

## Requirements

- PHP **7.4+**
- WordPress **7.0+** (the AI Client SDK ships in core)
  - On older WordPress, install the [WordPress AI Client](https://wordpress.org/plugins/wp-ai-client/) plugin separately

## Installation

| Method | How |
|---|---|
| **WordPress.org** | Search "AI Provider for OpenCode Zen" under **Plugins → Add New**, then install and activate |
| **Upload** | Download the zip and upload it via **Plugins → Add New → Upload Plugin** |
| **Composer** | `composer require mralaminahamed/ai-provider-for-opencode-zen` |

## Quick start

1. **Activate** the plugin.
2. Open **Settings → OpenCode Zen** (or the core **Settings → Connectors** screen) and paste your API key. Get one at [opencode.ai/zen/settings/api-keys](https://opencode.ai/zen/settings/api-keys).
3. Any AI-enabled plugin can now generate text through the `opencode-zen` provider:

```php
use WordPress\AiClient\AiClient;

echo AiClient::prompt('Explain quantum computing')
    ->usingProvider('opencode-zen')
    ->generateTextResult()
    ->toText();
```

See [docs/USAGE.md](docs/USAGE.md) for the standalone-Composer setup and per-request options.

## Configuration

Configure defaults on **Settings → OpenCode Zen** (option key `opencode_zen_settings`):

| Setting | Range | Default |
|---|---|---|
| Default Model | any available model | `gpt-5.5` |
| Temperature | 0.0–2.0 | 0.7 |
| Max Tokens | 1–200,000 | 4096 |
| Top P | 0.0–1.0 | 1.0 |
| Presence Penalty | -2.0–2.0 | 0.0 |
| Frequency Penalty | -2.0–2.0 | 0.0 |

The `OPENCODE_ZEN_API_KEY` environment variable takes priority over the stored key. Full resolution order is in [docs/ARCHITECTURE.md](docs/ARCHITECTURE.md#credential-resolution).

## Supported models

The live model list comes straight from the OpenCode Zen API, so you always see the latest models — the catalogue is public, so no key is needed to read it. If the API is unavailable, a **61-model fallback** keeps everything working:

- **GPT 5.x** — Sol / Terra / Luna, plus Pro, Mini, Nano, and Codex variants
- **Claude** — Fable 5, Opus 4.x, Sonnet 5 / 4.x, Haiku 4.5
- **Gemini 3.x** — Flash, Flash Lite, and Pro
- **More** — Grok, Qwen, DeepSeek, MiniMax, GLM, Kimi, and free-tier models

The complete, ID-by-ID catalogue is in [docs/MODELS.md](docs/MODELS.md).

## How it works

WordPress 7.0's AI Client is a provider-agnostic layer. Install one or more **provider plugins** — like this one — and any plugin built on the AI Client can generate content through whichever provider is active, switchable from the Connectors screen with no per-plugin reconfiguration. This plugin handles the OpenCode Zen side: credential resolution, live model discovery, and the OpenAI-compatible API calls. Details in [docs/ARCHITECTURE.md](docs/ARCHITECTURE.md).

## Documentation

| Doc | What's in it |
|---|---|
| [Usage](docs/USAGE.md) | WordPress + standalone Composer examples, API key resolution, generation options, credential filters |
| [Models](docs/MODELS.md) | How model discovery and caching work, and the full 61-model fallback catalogue |
| [Architecture](docs/ARCHITECTURE.md) | Provider identity, file layout, request flow, runtime SDK dependency |
| [Development](docs/DEVELOPMENT.md) | Build/test/lint/analysis scripts, the AI Client `replace` guard and dev-only stub install, CI and release |

## Development

```bash
composer install
composer test        # PHPUnit
composer phpcs       # WordPress Coding Standards
composer phpstan     # static analysis
composer release     # build the distributable zip
```

Full workflow — including the AI Client `replace` guard and the dev-only stub install that keeps PHPStan and PHPUnit green — is in [docs/DEVELOPMENT.md](docs/DEVELOPMENT.md).
