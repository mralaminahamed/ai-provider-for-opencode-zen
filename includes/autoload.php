 * PSR-4 autoloader for the plugin's own classes.
 *
 * The plugin used to load Composer's autoloader, which meant a copy installed
 * from git rather than from a built zip had no `vendor/` and silently did
 * nothing — it activated, registered no provider, and said nothing about it.
 *
 * There was never a runtime dependency to justify that. `composer.json`
 * requires `php` and `ext-json` and nothing else; everything in `vendor/` is
 * development tooling, so Composer's autoloader existed only to map this
 * plugin's own namespace onto `includes/`. That is what this file does, in a
 * form that ships with the source and cannot go missing.
 *
 * The three official WordPress AI provider plugins do the same and ship no
 * vendor directory at all.
 *
 * @package OpenCodeZen\OpenCodeZenAiProvider
